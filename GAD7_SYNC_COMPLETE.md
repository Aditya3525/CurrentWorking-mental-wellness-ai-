## Data Flow Verification

### ‚úÖ Assessment Submission
```typescript
// 1. User completes GAD-7 assessment
AssessmentFlow ‚Üí calculates score (0-21)
                ‚Üí determines interpretation (Minimal/Mild/Moderate/Severe)
                ‚Üí creates categoryBreakdown with "overall" category

// 2. Payload sent to backend
{
  assessmentType: 'anxiety_assessment',
  score: 47.6,           // normalized to 0-100
  rawScore: 10,          // actual GAD-7 score 0-21
  maxScore: 21,          // max possible score
  responses: {...},
  categoryBreakdown: {
    overall: {
      raw: 10,
      normalized: 47.6,
      interpretation: 'Moderate anxiety'
    }
  }
}

// 3. Backend processes and saves
AssessmentsController ‚Üí validates payload
                      ‚Üí saves to database
                      ‚Üí builds insights

// 4. Insights Service interprets
assessmentInsightsService ‚Üí uses raw score for interpretation
                          ‚Üí generates recommendations
                          ‚Üí calculates trends
```

### ‚úÖ Results Display
```typescript
// 5. Frontend receives results
App ‚Üí updates assessment history
    ‚Üí updates insights
    ‚Üí navigates to results

// 6. InsightsResults displays
InsightsResults ‚Üí shows overall score
                ‚Üí shows interpretation
                ‚Üí shows "Assessment Details" section
                ‚Üí displays "Overall Score" with interpretation
                ‚Üí shows personalized recommendations
```

## GAD-7 Score Interpretation

### Raw Score Ranges (0-21)
| Raw Score | Severity | Interpretation | Action |
|-----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| 0-4 | **Minimal** | Minimal anxiety symptoms | Continue self-monitoring |
| 5-9 | **Mild** | Mild anxiety disorder | Practice grounding techniques |
| 10-14 | **Moderate** | Moderate anxiety disorder | Consider coping strategies, thought downloads |
| 15-21 | **Severe** | Severe anxiety disorder | Seek professional support recommended |

### Normalized Score (0-100)
- The raw score is normalized to 0-100 scale for consistency with other assessments
- Formula: `(rawScore / 21) √ó 100`
- Example: Raw score 10 ‚Üí 47.6% normalized

---

## Recommendations System

### ‚úÖ Updated Recommendation Logic

**For Normalized Score ‚â• 60% (Raw ‚â• 13):**
- "Try a guided breathing or mindfulness practice to regulate your nervous system"
- "Consider incorporating daily relaxation exercises like progressive muscle relaxation"

**For Normalized Score 40-60% (Raw 8-12):**
- "Practice grounding techniques when feeling anxious or restless"

**For Severe Anxiety (Raw ‚â• 15):**
- "Your anxiety levels are high. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support"

**For Moderate Anxiety (Raw 10-14):**
- "Set aside a daily 5-minute thought download to ease worry loops"

**For Improving Trend:**
- "Great job improving your anxiety score‚Äîkeep reinforcing the routines that helped"

**For Declining Trend:**
- "Recent anxiety patterns show some setbacks. Consider revisiting coping strategies or reaching out for support"

## Removed Features

### ‚ùå Category-Specific Scoring
**Before (Old 20-question assessment):**
- Cognitive category (worry, intrusive thoughts)
- Physical category (tension, physical symptoms)
- Behavioral category (avoidance, restlessness)

**After (GAD-7):**
- Single overall score only
- No sub-categories

### ‚ùå Reverse Scoring
**Before:** Some questions were reverse-scored
**After:** All GAD-7 questions scored directly (0-3)
