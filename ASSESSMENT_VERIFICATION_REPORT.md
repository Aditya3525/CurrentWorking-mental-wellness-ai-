## Summary of Issues

### Critical Problems

1. **Frontend Doesn't Fetch from Backend**
   - All assessment questions are **hardcoded** in `CombinedAssessmentFlow.tsx`
   - No API call to `/assessments` endpoint to fetch from database
   - Backend has correct data but frontend ignores it

2. **Wrong Assessment Versions Used**
   | Assessment Type | Reference Doc | Backend | Frontend |
   |----------------|---------------|---------|----------|
   | Anxiety | GAD-7 (7Q) | ✅ GAD-7 | ❌ GAD-2 (2Q) |
   | Depression | PHQ-9 (9Q) | ✅ PHQ-9 | ❌ PHQ-2 (2Q) |
   | Stress | PSS-10 (10Q) | ✅ PSS-10 | ❌ PSS-4 (4Q) |
   | Trauma | PCL-5 (20Q) | ✅ PCL-5 | ❌ PC-PTSD-5 (5Q) |
   | Personality | Mini-IPIP (20Q) | ✅ Mini-IPIP | ❌ Big Five (5Q) |
   | Overthinking | Brooding (5Q) | ✅ Brooding | ❌ RRS-4 (Different) |
   | Emotional Intel | EI-10 (10Q) | ✅ EI-10 | ❌ EQ-5 (5Q) |

3. **Question Text Discrepancies**
   - Even where question counts match, wording differs
   - Brooding questions completely different in frontend

4. **Missing Reverse Scoring Flags**
   - Backend correctly marks reverse items
   - Frontend doesn't implement reverse scoring for all assessments

5. **Scoring Logic Inconsistencies**
   - Frontend uses percentage-based scoring (0-100)
   - Reference doc uses raw scores with clinical cutoffs
   - Backend likely uses raw scores but frontend converts

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Remove Hardcoded Questions**
   - Delete `createAssessmentLibrary()` function from frontend
   - Implement API call to fetch assessments from backend

2. **Update API Integration**
   ```typescript
   // Add this to assessmentsApi in frontend/src/services/api.ts
   async getAvailableAssessments(): Promise<ApiResponse<Assessment[]>> {
     return apiClient.get('/assessments/catalog');
   }
   ```

3. **Create Backend Endpoint**
   ```typescript
   // Add to backend/src/controllers/assessmentsController.ts
   export const getAssessmentCatalog = async (req: any, res: Response) => {
     const assessments = await prisma.assessmentDefinition.findMany({
       include: {
         questions: {
           include: {
             options: true
           },
           orderBy: { order: 'asc' }
         }
       },
       where: { isActive: true }
     });
     res.json({ success: true, data: assessments });
   };
   ```

4. **Update Frontend Components**
   - Modify `CombinedAssessmentFlow.tsx` to fetch from API
   - Update `AssessmentFlow.tsx` similarly
   - Implement proper reverse scoring based on backend flags

5. **Fix Assessment Mappings**
   - Update assessment type mappings to use correct versions
   - Map frontend IDs to backend assessment definition IDs

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - Backend database should be the only source for assessment questions
   - Frontend should always fetch dynamically

2. **Version Control**
   - Add version field to assessment definitions
   - Support multiple versions of same assessment

3. **Validation**
   - Add backend validation to ensure scoring logic matches clinical standards
   - Create unit tests comparing backend scoring with reference doc

4. **Documentation**
   - Document which assessment version is being used
   - Maintain changelog when questions/scoring changes

## Technical Details

### Backend Database Structure

```typescript
// Assessment Definition (seed data)
{
  id: 'gad7',
  name: 'GAD-7',
  type: 'Advanced',
  category: 'Anxiety',
  description: '...',
  questions: [
    {
      id: 'gad7_q1',
      text: 'Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge',
      order: 1,
      responseType: 'scale',
      options: [
        { id: '...', value: 0, text: 'Not at all', order: 1 },
        { id: '...', value: 1, text: 'Several days', order: 2 },
        // ...
      ]
    },
    // ... 6 more questions
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Current Structure

```typescript
// Hardcoded in CombinedAssessmentFlow.tsx
library['anxiety_gad2'] = {
  id: 'anxiety_gad2',
  title: 'Anxiety Screening (GAD-2)',
  questions: [
    // Only 2 questions hardcoded
  ]
};
```

### Required Frontend Structure

```typescript
// Should fetch from backend
const assessments = await assessmentsApi.getAvailableAssessments();
const library = assessments.data.reduce((acc, assessment) => {
  acc[assessment.id] = {
    id: assessment.id,
    title: assessment.name,
    description: assessment.description,
    questions: assessment.questions.map(q => ({
      id: q.id,
      text: q.text,
      options: q.options.map(opt => ({
        value: opt.value,
        label: opt.text
      })),
      reverse: q.reverseScored // if implemented
    }))
  };
  return acc;
}, {});
```

## Conclusion

**Status: ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**

The assessment system has a fundamental architecture problem:
- ✅ Backend has correct, complete assessments matching reference document
- ❌ Frontend ignores backend and uses hardcoded short versions
- ❌ Users are taking incomplete assessments (2-5 questions instead of 7-20)
- ❌ Clinical validity is compromised

**Action Required:** Implement proper API integration to fetch assessments from backend database.

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours to fix completely
- 1 hour: Add backend endpoint
- 2 hours: Update frontend to fetch from API
- 1 hour: Test all 7 assessments
- 1-2 hours: Fix scoring logic and reverse items
