# 🔧 Onboarding Exit Flow - Fix Applied

## Issue Identified
When users clicked "Exit onboarding", they were being redirected to an unexpected page instead of the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The onboarding exit flow was routing users through the assessment-invite screen, which could be confusing for users who just want to explore the dashboard.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Updated App.tsx - Smart Exit Routing**
**File:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

```tsx
onExit={() => {
  // When user exits onboarding, give them choice to take assessment or go to dashboard
  if (user?.hasCompletedOnboarding) {
    // If they've already completed onboarding before, go straight to dashboard
    navigateTo('dashboard');
  } else {
    // First-time users get the assessment invite
    navigateTo('assessment-invite');
  }
}}
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ If user has completed onboarding before → Goes directly to **dashboard**
- ✅ If first-time user → Shows **assessment invite** (they can skip to dashboard from there)

---

### 2. **Updated OnboardingFlow.tsx - Clearer Exit Messaging**
**File:** `frontend/src/components/features/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.tsx`

#### Change 1: Exit Button Label
**Before:** "Exit"  
**After:** "Skip to Dashboard"

```tsx
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  onClick={handleExitWithoutSaving}
  className="flex items-center gap-2 text-muted-foreground"
  title="Exit to dashboard and complete onboarding later"
>
  <LogOut className="h-4 w-4" />
  Skip to Dashboard  {/* ← Changed from "Exit" */}
</Button>
```

#### Change 2: Exit Confirmation Message
**Before:** "Exit onboarding? Your current responses will be saved so you can continue later."  
**After:** "Exit onboarding and continue to your dashboard? Your current responses will be saved so you can complete this later."

```tsx
const confirmExit = window.confirm(
  'Exit onboarding and continue to your dashboard? Your current responses will be saved so you can complete this later.'
);
```

#### Change 3: Exit Toast Message
**Before:** "Come back anytime—your progress is waiting."  
**After:** "You can complete your profile anytime from Settings."

```tsx
push({
  title: 'Onboarding paused',
  description: 'You can complete your profile anytime from Settings.',  {/* ← More helpful */}
  type: 'info'
});
```
