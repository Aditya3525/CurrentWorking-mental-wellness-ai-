# üöÄ NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED - Proactive Engagement & Personalization

## ‚ú® Features Completed (Session 3)

### 1. ‚úÖ Proactive Check-ins

  - Crisis follow-up (4+ hours after concerning conversation)
  - High anxiety/depression scores + 2+ days inactive
  
- **üü° Medium Priority:**
  - Pattern deviation (regular user misses their usual schedule)
  - Progress maintenance (improving user goes 5+ days without contact)
  
- **üîµ Low Priority:**
  - Weekly check-in (7+ days since last chat)

**Example Messages:**
```
High Priority:
"I've been thinking about our last conversation. How are you feeling now? 
I'm here if you need support."

Medium Priority:
"Hey there! I noticed we haven't chatted in a few days. Everything okay? 
I'm here whenever you need to talk."

Low Priority:
"It's been a week! I wanted to check in and see how things are going.

```

```typescript
{
  id: string;

  targetValue: 50; // Target anxiety score
  currentValue: 65; // Current score
  progress: 30; // 30% complete
  status: "active" | "completed" | "paused";
  milestones: [
    { name: "Daily breathing exercises", completed: true },

2. Backend analyzes:
   - Last message timestamp
   - Recent conversation content
   - Assessment scores
   - User patterns
   - Wellness trends
3. Determines priority (high/medium/low)
4. Returns check-in message if needed
5. Frontend displays notification
6. User clicks "Let's Talk" ‚Üí Opens chat
```

### Mood-Based Greeting Flow
```
1. User opens chat ‚Üí Frontend calls /api/chat/greeting
2. Backend analyzes:
   - Current time of day
   - Recent assessment scores
   - Wellness trend
   - Recurring themes
   - User's first name
3. Generates personalized greeting
4. Returns greeting text
5. Frontend displays as first message
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Proactive Check-in Logic
```typescript
// High priority: Crisis follow-up
if (hasCrisisIndicators && hoursSinceLastChat >= 4) {
  return {
    shouldCheckIn: true,
    priority: 'high',
    message: "I've been thinking about our last conversation..."
  };
}

// Medium priority: Pattern deviation
if (memory.averageSessionsPerWeek >= 3 && daysSinceLastChat >= 3) {
  return {
    shouldCheckIn: true,
    priority: 'medium',
    message: "Hey there! I noticed we haven't chatted..."
  };
}

// Low priority: Weekly check-in
if (daysSinceLastChat >= 7) {
  return {
    shouldCheckIn: true,
    priority: 'low',
    message: "It's been a week! I wanted to check in..."
  };
}
```

### Mood-Based Greeting Logic
```typescript
const hour = new Date().getHours();
const timeGreeting = hour < 12 ? 'Good morning' : 
                     hour < 17 ? 'Good afternoon' : 'Good evening';

if (wellnessTrend === 'improving') {
  return `${timeGreeting}, ${userName}! üåü I can see you've been making progress...`;
}

if (anxietyScore > 70) {
  return `${timeGreeting}, ${userName}. I'm here for you. Take a deep breath...`;
}

// Contextual based on time and themes
if (recurringThemes.includes('work') && hour >= 9 && hour <= 17) {
  return `${timeGreeting}, ${userName}! How's your workday going so far?`;
}
```
