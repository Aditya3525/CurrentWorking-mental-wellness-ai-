## üë• Team Handoff Notes

### For Frontend Developers
- All new components are in `features/` folders by domain
- Follow the pattern for future components (hooks, memoization, types)
- Dashboard widgets are modular - easy to add more
- Assessment flows can be extended for new assessment types

### For Backend Developers
- Frontend expects `AssessmentTemplate` structure from API
- Combined assessments use batch submission endpoint
- Scoring happens client-side with `scoreAdvancedAssessment` utility
- All API types are centralized in `services/api.ts`

### For Designers
- All components use shadcn/ui design system
- Color scheme: primary, muted, destructive from theme
- Icons from lucide-react library
- Spacing uses Tailwind scale (p-4, gap-3, etc.)

### For QA
- See testing checklist above
- Focus on keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Test with real backend once available
- Check localStorage persistence across sessions

- Props interface with descriptions
- Usage examples in summary files

### Architecture Documentation
- API integration patterns in `ASSESSMENT_FLOW_FIXES.md`
