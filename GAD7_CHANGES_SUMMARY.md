### 2. Scoring Logic
**File:** `frontend/src/components/features/assessment/AssessmentFlow.tsx`

- ✅ Implemented GAD-7 standard scoring (sum of all items, 0-21 range)
- ✅ Added severity interpretation:
  - 0-4: Minimal anxiety
  - 5-9: Mild anxiety
  - 10-14: Moderate anxiety
  - 15-21: Severe anxiety

- ✅ Questions match official GAD-7 standard
- ✅ Proper response options (0-3 scale) configured

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive GAD7_IMPLEMENTATION.md guide
- ✅ Included scoring logic, interpretation, and clinical references

## 📋 GAD-7 Questions

1. Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge
2. Not being able to stop or control worrying

## 🎯 Key Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Questions** | 20 questions | 7 questions | 65% reduction |
| **Time** | 6-8 minutes | 2-3 minutes | 60% faster |
| **Score Range** | 0-80 | 0-21 | Standardized |
| **Validation** | Custom | Clinical standard | ✅ Validated |
| **License** | Unknown | Public domain | ✅ Legal |

## 🔄 What Changed

### Question Format
**Before:** Custom questions like "I often feel as if something bad will happen soon."
**After:** Standardized GAD-7 questions with clinical validation

### Scoring Method
**Before:** Category-based (cognitive, physical, behavioral) with reverse scoring
**After:** Simple sum with clinical interpretation ranges

### Assessment Length
**Before:** 20 questions, ~7 minutes
**After:** 7 questions, ~2.5 minutes

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Deploy
1. Test the assessment flow with the new questions
2. Verify score calculation and interpretation
3. Check that results save correctly to database
4. Ensure progress tracking updates properly

### Optional Enhancements
- Add trending/comparison charts for GAD-7 scores
- Display interpretation badges (Minimal/Mild/Moderate/Severe)
- Show clinical recommendations based on score ranges
- Add crisis intervention for severe scores (≥15)

## 📊 Score Interpretation

```
0━━━━━4━━━━━9━━━━━14━━━━━21
   Minimal  Mild  Moderate  Severe
```

- **0-4**: Minimal anxiety - No intervention needed
- **5-9**: Mild anxiety - Watchful waiting, self-help
- **10-14**: Moderate anxiety - Consider intervention
- **15-21**: Severe anxiety - Clinical intervention recommended

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Minimal Anxiety
- All questions answered "0" (Not at all)
- Expected: Raw score = 0, Interpretation = "Minimal anxiety"

### Test Case 2: Mild Anxiety
- Questions answered mix of 0s and 1s, total = 7
- Expected: Raw score = 7, Interpretation = "Mild anxiety"

### Test Case 3: Moderate Anxiety
- Questions answered mostly 2s, total = 12
- Expected: Raw score = 12, Interpretation = "Moderate anxiety"

### Test Case 4: Severe Anxiety
- Questions answered mostly 3s, total = 18
- Expected: Raw score = 18, Interpretation = "Severe anxiety"

## 📝 Database Compatibility

The database structure supports GAD-7 through:
- `AssessmentResult.responses` (JSON string of answers)
- `AssessmentResult.score` (normalized 0-100)
- `AssessmentResult.rawScore` (GAD-7 raw 0-21)
- `AssessmentResult.maxScore` (21)
- `AssessmentResult.categoryScores` (interpretation data)

## ✨ Benefits

### For Users

- ✅ Comparable to clinical assessments

### For Clinicians
- ✅ Standardized, validated tool
- ✅ Established clinical cutoffs
