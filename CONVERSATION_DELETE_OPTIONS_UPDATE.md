## 🎯 **What Changed**

Updated the conversation sidebar menu to include **3 distinct options** with appropriate icons:

### 1. ✏️ **Rename** (Edit2 icon)
- **Action:** Change the conversation title
- **Effect:** Updates the display name of the conversation
- **Database:** Updates `title` field in conversations table
- **Icon:** ✏️ Edit2
- **Confirmation:** None (can be undone by renaming again)

### 2. 🗄️ **Delete (Hide)** (Archive icon)
- **Action:** Soft delete - removes from sidebar view
- **Effect:** Conversation is archived (hidden from active list)
- **Database:** Sets `isArchived = true` in conversations table
- **Data Preserved:** ✅ All messages and data remain in database
- **Reversible:** ✅ Can be restored by setting `isArchived = false`
- **Icon:** 🗄️ Archive
- **Confirmation:** "Hide this conversation from sidebar? (You can restore it later)"

### 3. ❌ **Permanent Delete** (Trash icon)
- **Action:** Hard delete - completely removes from database
- **Effect:** Conversation and all messages are permanently deleted
- **Database:** Deletes row from conversations table (CASCADE deletes all messages)
- **Data Preserved:** ❌ No - data is permanently removed
- **Reversible:** ❌ Cannot be undone
- **Icon:** ❌ Trash
- **Confirmation:** "⚠️ PERMANENTLY delete this conversation?\n\nThis will remove all messages forever and cannot be undone!"

## 📋 **UI Layout**

### Conversation Item Menu (⋮):
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ✏️ Rename              │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ 🗄️ Delete (Hide)       │
│ ❌ Permanent Delete     │  ← Red text
└─────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

### 1. **ConversationItem.tsx**
**Changes:**
- Added `onPermanentDelete` prop
- Removed `onArchive` prop (not needed anymore)
- Updated dropdown menu structure:
  - Rename → Edit2 icon
  - Delete (Hide) → Archive icon, soft delete confirmation
  - Permanent Delete → Trash icon, strong confirmation, red text

**Code:**
```typescript
interface ConversationItemProps {
  conversation: Conversation;
  isActive: boolean;
  onClick: () => void;
  onRename: (id: string, newTitle: string) => void;
  onDelete: (id: string) => void;  // Soft delete (archive)
  onPermanentDelete: (id: string) => void;  // Hard delete
}
```

### 2. **ConversationHistorySidebar.tsx**
**Changes:**
- Split delete logic into two functions:
  - `handleDelete()` - Archives conversation (soft delete)
  - `handlePermanentDelete()` - Deletes permanently (hard delete)
- Updated ConversationItem to receive both handlers

**Code:**
```typescript
const handleDelete = (conversationId: string) => {
  // Soft delete - just archive the conversation
  archiveConversation.mutate({ conversationId, isArchived: true });
};

const handlePermanentDelete = (conversationId: string) => {
  // Hard delete - permanently remove from database
  deleteConversation.mutate(conversationId);
};
```

## 🔄 **Backend Behavior**

### Soft Delete (Archive):
```
POST /api/conversations/:id/archive
Body: { isArchived: true }

Effect: Sets conversation.isArchived = true
Messages: Preserved
Cascade: None
```

### Hard Delete (Permanent):
```
DELETE /api/conversations/:id

Effect: Deletes conversation row
Messages: All cascade deleted (onDelete: Cascade)
Cascade: All chat_messages with matching conversationId
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### Data Safety:
- **Soft Delete (Archive):** Data is safe, can be restored
- **Permanent Delete:** Data is gone forever, no recovery possible

### Current Limitation:
- Archived conversations cannot be viewed in UI yet
- Future enhancement: Add "Archived" tab to view/restore archived conversations

### Recommended Usage:
- Use **Delete (Hide)** for conversations you might want to review later
- Use **Permanent Delete** only for conversations you're absolutely sure you want to remove

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

### Archived Conversations View:
Add a toggle to show archived conversations:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ [Active] [Archived] │  ← Tab switcher
├─────────────────────┤
│ TODAY               │
│ • Conversation 1    │
│ • Conversation 2    │
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Restore Function:
Add "Restore" option for archived conversations:
```
Archived Conversations:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ • Old conversation      │
│   [Restore]             │ ← Unarchives conversation
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Bulk Operations:
- Archive multiple conversations at once
- Permanently delete multiple archived conversations
- "Empty Trash" button to delete all archived
