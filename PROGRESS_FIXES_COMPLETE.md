- Bugs Fixed: **2 critical issues**
- Enhancements Added: **Error boundaries for all widgets**

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. countMoodEntriesInRange Boundary Issue ✅
**Status:** FIXED

**Problem:**
The function was using `Date.now() - days * DAY_IN_MS` as the cutoff, which:
- Counted partial days (hours/minutes) instead of full days
- Led to inconsistent results depending on what time of day the function ran
- Example: At 2 PM, "last 7 days" would include entries from 7 days ago at 2 PM, not from the start of that day

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const cutoff = Date.now() - days * DAY_IN_MS;

// AFTER
const todayStart = toStartOfDay(new Date());
const cutoff = todayStart - (days - 1) * DAY_IN_MS;
```

**Changes:**
- Calculate cutoff as start of day N days ago
- This ensures full-day counting (midnight to midnight)
- Added JSDoc comment explaining behavior
- "Last N days" now consistently means "N full days including today"

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/features/profile/Progress.tsx` (lines 205-228)

**Test Impact:**
- Fixed "Count entries in last 1 day" test ✅
- Clarified "Count entries in last 3 days" test expectation ✅

### 2. Conversation Widgets API Verification ✅
**Status:** VERIFIED - Already Has Proper Error Handling

**Investigation:**
Checked if conversation widgets could crash the app if API endpoints are unavailable.

**Findings:**
Both `ConversationSummaryWidget` and `ConversationTopicsWidget` already have comprehensive error handling:

**ConversationSummaryWidget:**
- ✅ Loading skeleton state
- ✅ Error state with red border/background and error message
- ✅ Empty state for no data
- ✅ Retry capability with period toggles (7d/30d)
- ✅ localStorage token authentication
- ✅ Graceful degradation

**ConversationTopicsWidget:**
- ✅ Handles `{success, data, error}` response format
- ✅ AbortController for cleanup on unmount
- ✅ Loading/error/empty states
- ✅ Proper API response parsing

**Conclusion:** No changes needed - widgets are production-ready.

### 3. Division by Zero Safety ✅
**Status:** VERIFIED - Already Protected

**Investigation:**
Searched for potential division by zero issues in plan progress calculations.

**Findings:**
All division operations already have ternary operator guards:
```typescript
totalModules ? Math.round((completedModules / totalModules) * 100) : 0
totalModules > 0 ? completionPercentage : 'N/A'
```

**Conclusion:** No changes needed - division safety already implemented.

## 🛡️ Enhancements Added

### Error Boundary Implementation
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED

**Purpose:**
Prevent individual widget failures from crashing the entire Progress section.

**New Component:**
Created `frontend/src/components/ui/error-boundary.tsx`:
- Class component implementing React error boundary
- Catches errors in child components
- Shows user-friendly error UI with retry options
- Includes developer-only error details in development mode
- Prevents cascading failures

**Features:**
- ✅ Custom fallback titles and messages
- ✅ "Try Again" button to reset error state
- ✅ Optional "Refresh Page" button
- ✅ Stack trace display in development mode
- ✅ Graceful degradation

**Widgets Protected:**
All 6 analytics widgets now wrapped in ErrorBoundary:
1. **StreakTracker** - "Streak Tracker Error"
2. **MoodCalendarHeatmap** - "Mood Calendar Error"
3. **WellnessScoreTrend** - "Wellness Trend Error"
4. **AssessmentComparisonChart** - "Assessment Chart Error"
5. **ConversationSummaryWidget** - "Conversation Summary Error"
6. **ConversationTopicsWidget** - "Topics Error"
7. **EmotionalPatternWidget** - "Emotional Pattern Error"

**Example Usage:**
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary 
  fallbackTitle="Mood Calendar Error" 
  fallbackMessage="Unable to load mood calendar."
  showRefresh={false}
>
  <MoodCalendarHeatmap entries={moodHeatmapEntries} days={120} />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## 📊 Test Suite Updates

### Dynamic Date Generation
**Problem:** Tests used hardcoded October 2025 dates, which became "future dates" and caused failures.

**Solution:**
Created dynamic date generator:
```javascript
const generateMoodEntry = (id, mood, emoji, daysAgo) => {
  const date = new Date();
  date.setDate(date.getDate() - daysAgo);
  return {
    id,
    mood,
    emoji,
    date: date.toISOString().split('T')[0],
    createdAt: date.toISOString()
  };
};
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Tests work regardless of when they're run
- ✅ Dates are always relative to today
- ✅ Eliminates hardcoded date dependencies
- ✅ More maintainable and reliable

### Test Expectation Corrections
Updated test expectations to match corrected function behavior:
- **"Last 3 days"** now correctly expects 3 entries (today, yesterday, 2 days ago)
- **"Unsorted entries"** test now uses consecutive days to properly test sorting
- **countMoodEntriesInRange** synced with fixed implementation
