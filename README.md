# Mental Wellbeing AI App

An AI-powered mental wellbeing platform that combines guided onboarding, personalized care plans, crisis-aware chat assistance, and an admin-managed content library. This repository is a TypeScript monorepo with a Vite/React frontend and an Express/Prisma backend that integrates multiple LLM providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Ollama) through a unified service layer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js **18+** and npm **8+**
- Optional: PostgreSQL/MySQL for production (SQLite is bundled for local prototyping)
- AI provider keys (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) if you want live LLM responses

### 2. Install dependencies and prepare the database

```powershell
npm run setup
```

`setup` installs root/backend/frontend dependencies, generates Prisma client, and runs pending migrations against the SQLite dev database (`backend/prisma/dev.db`).

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create `backend/.env` using the sample below (see `backend/README.md` for more options):

```env
# Server
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Database (SQLite by default – override for Postgres/MySQL)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# JWT & session secrets
JWT_SECRET=replace_me
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Optional: AI providers (at least one required for chat features)
GEMINI_API_KEY_1=your_key
OPENAI_API_KEY_1=your_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_1=your_key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_key
AI_PROVIDER_PRIORITY=gemini,huggingface,openai,anthropic,ollama
AI_ENABLE_FALLBACK=true
AI_USAGE_LOGGING=true

# Admin allowlist
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@example.com,admin@mentalwellbeing.ai
```

Frontend environment variables live in `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```

### 4. Seed demo data (optional)

```powershell
cd backend
npm run seed
```

This ensures admin accounts (`admin@example.com` / `admin123`, `admin@mentalwellbeing.ai` / `admin123`), demo users (`demo@mentalwellness.app` / `Demo@123`), and starter practices/content.

### 5. Run the full stack

```powershell
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend REST API & AI services: http://localhost:5000

Individual targets:

```powershell
npm run dev:frontend   # Vite dev server
npm run dev:backend    # Express (nodemon)
```

## 🧪 Tooling & Quality

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint (frontend + backend). |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type checks for both workspaces. |
| `npm run format` | Apply Prettier formatting. |
| `npm run test` | Run tests for both frontend and backend. |
| `npm run test:backend` | Run backend tests (includes provider tests). |
| `npm run test:frontend` | Run frontend tests with Vitest. |
| `npm run db:studio` | Launch Prisma Studio for browsing the database. |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Run database migrations. |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate Prisma client. |

Backend debug scripts (inside `backend/`):

- `test-ai-providers.js`, `test-gemini.js` – verify AI integrations.
- `check-db.js` – confirm Prisma connection.
- `test-chat-*.js` – exercise chat endpoints with sample inputs.

- `simulate-15day-user-journey.js` – comprehensive user simulation.

---

## 🌐 Deployment Hints

- **Frontend**: deploy `frontend/dist` to Vercel/Netlify. `vercel.json` rewrites all routes to `index.html`.
- **Backend**: Docker/Render/Railway templates under `backend/` (`render.yaml`, `railway.json`, `Procfile`, `web.config`). Ensure environment secrets, production database URL, and secure session storage.
- **Database**: switch `DATABASE_URL` to your managed Postgres/MySQL. Migrations are generated via Prisma; `schema-planetscale.prisma` offers a PlanetScale-ready schema if you need `relationMode = prisma`.
- **AI Providers**: follow `GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md`, `HUGGINGFACE_INTEGRATION.md`, and other docs for provider-specific setup.

---

## 🙋‍♀️ Admin Console

- Admin login page lives on the public landing screen.
- Session-backed JWT stored in Express session; routes guarded by `requireAdmin` middleware.
- Upload endpoints save files to `backend/uploads/{thumbnails|media}`; Express serves them via `/uploads/*`.
- Admin dashboards (React) retrieve practices/content, allow metadata edits, and toggle publish states.
