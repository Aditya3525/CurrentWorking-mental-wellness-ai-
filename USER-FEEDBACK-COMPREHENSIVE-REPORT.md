### What Needs Improvement 🔧

#### 1. ⏰ Notifications & Reminders (Priority: HIGH)

**Suggested Solutions:**
- 🔔 Customizable daily reminder time

**Impact:** Medium (enhances value, especially for therapy clients)

**Suggested Features:**
- 📈 Correlation analysis (e.g., "Lower anxiety on days with 8+ hrs sleep")
- 📊 Weekly digest summaries (email or in-app)
- 📄 PDF export for therapist sharing
- 🎨 More chart types (scatter plots, heatmaps, radar charts)
- 📅 Calendar view with mood colors

**Implementation Priority:** **MEDIUM** - High value-add for existing users

---

#### 3. 🎯 Goal Setting & Milestones (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Problem:**
> "Let me set specific goals like 'Reduce anxiety to under 30' or 'Maintain 7-day streak'. Celebrate when I hit milestones."

**Problem:**
> "A structured journaling section would complement the mood notes. Prompts like 'What am I grateful for?' or 'What triggered my anxiety today?' could deepen self-reflection."

**Suggested Features:**
- 📝 Daily journal prompts:
  - Gratitude journal
  - Trigger identification
  - Cognitive reframing exercises
  - Future self-letters
- 🔍 Searchable journal archive

**This is a genuinely valuable mental health app** that delivers real results for its target audience. Sarah's 66% anxiety reduction in 15 days is clinically significant and demonstrates the app's therapeutic potential.

**Strengths far outweigh weaknesses.** The core experience—AI chat, progress tracking, mood logging—is excellent. Enhancement requests are refinements, not fundamental flaws.
