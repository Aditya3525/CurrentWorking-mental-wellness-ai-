## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User clicks time period (7 or 30 days)
    ↓
Frontend calls GET /api/chat/summary/:userId?days={period}
    ↓
Backend queries ChatMessage table (filtered by date range)
    ↓
Backend analyzes messages for topics, sentiment, engagement
    ↓
conversationMemoryService.getConversationSummary() processes data
    ↓
Response includes metrics, trends, insights
    ↓
Widget renders summary card with formatted data
```

### Engagement Level Calculation
The backend determines engagement based on message count:
- **High** (🔥): 20+ messages in period
- **Medium** (⚡): 10-19 messages in period
- **Low** (💤): <10 messages in period

### Emotional Trend Detection
Backend analyzes sentiment of all messages in period:
- **Improving** 📈: Positive sentiment > Negative sentiment × 1.5
- **Declining** 📉: Negative sentiment > Positive sentiment × 1.5
- **Stable** ➖: Relatively balanced sentiment distribution

### Time Period Switching
Users can toggle between two views:
- **7 Days**: Weekly summary (good for tracking recent progress)
- **30 Days**: Monthly summary (good for identifying long-term patterns)

Button state changes dynamically with active period highlighted.

## UI/UX Features

### Metrics Grid
Three-column layout showing core statistics:

1. **Messages** 💬
   - Large number display (2xl font)
   - Icon: MessageSquare
   - Shows total conversations in period

2. **Mood Trend** 📊
   - Icon changes based on trend:
     * TrendingUp (green) for improving
     * TrendingDown (red) for declining
     * Minus (blue) for stable
   - Capitalized text with matching color

3. **Engagement** 🎯
   - Badge with color coding:
     * Green: "🔥 Highly Active"
     * Yellow: "⚡ Moderately Active"
     * Gray: "💤 Light Activity"

### Key Insights Section

### Period Toggle

### Visual Design

## Integration with Existing Features

### Leverages Existing APIs ✅
- **No new backend code required!**
- Uses `/api/chat/summary/:userId` endpoint created earlier
- Shares authentication and security with other widgets
- Benefits from existing conversation memory service

### Works With:
- **Conversation Topics Widget**: Complementary data (topics + summary)
- **Emotional Pattern Widget**: Reinforces mood trend insights
- **AI Chat Service**: Real-time updates as users chat
- **Dashboard Customizer**: Can be shown/hidden by users
- **Authentication System**: Respects user sessions and permissions

### Data Consistency:
- **Top Topics**: Matches topic labels from Conversation Topics Widget
- **Emotional Trend**: Aligns with sentiment distribution in Emotional Pattern Widget
- **Engagement Level**: Correlates with conversation frequency

## User Value Delivered

### Quick Overview
Users get an at-a-glance summary without detailed analysis:
- "How active have I been?"
- "Is my mood improving?"
- "What am I talking about most?"

### Time Comparison
Toggle between 7-day and 30-day views allows:
- **Short-term tracking**: Week-by-week progress monitoring
- **Long-term patterns**: Monthly trend identification
- **Flexible analysis**: Switch views based on need

### Actionable Insights
Key insights provide personalized observations:
- "You've been consistently engaging with self-care topics"
- "Positive shift in emotional tone over the past week"
- "Consider exploring mindfulness practices more"

### Motivation & Progress
- **High engagement** badge validates active participation
- **Improving trend** encourages continued effort
- **Top topics** show what matters most to the user

## Mental Health Benefits

### Self-Awareness
- Visualizes conversation patterns users may not notice
- Highlights predominant discussion topics
- Shows emotional trajectory over time

### Progress Tracking
- Concrete metrics (message count) show engagement
- Trend indicators validate improvement or signal concern
- Period comparison helps identify changes

### Positive Reinforcement
- "Highly Active" badge celebrates consistent engagement
- "Improving" trend icon provides visual encouragement
- Key insights acknowledge user's efforts

### Early Intervention
- "Declining" trend alerts user to potential regression
- "Low Activity" may indicate disengagement
- Topic patterns can reveal emerging concerns

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps
1. ✅ Login as user with existing chat history
2. ✅ Navigate to Dashboard
3. ✅ Verify "Conversation Summary" widget appears
4. ✅ Check that metrics display correctly (messages, trend, engagement)
5. ✅ Verify top topics show with emoji labels
6. ✅ Check key insights appear (if generated)
7. ✅ Click "7 Days" button - verify it's highlighted
8. ✅ Click "30 Days" button - verify data refreshes and button highlights
9. ✅ Test with user who has NO chat history (empty state)
10. ✅ Test error handling (disconnect network)
11. ✅ Test visibility toggle in DashboardCustomizer
12. ✅ Verify responsive design on mobile/tablet
13. ✅ Check all engagement levels (high/medium/low) render correctly
14. ✅ Verify all emotional trends (improving/stable/declining) display properly

### Edge Cases
- User with exactly 0 messages → Shows empty state
- User with exactly 10 messages → Boundary for medium engagement
- User with exactly 20 messages → Boundary for high engagement
- 50/50 positive/negative ratio → Shows "stable" trend
- All neutral messages → Shows "stable" trend

## Performance Considerations
- **API Calls**: Single fetch per period change (not per render)
- **Caching**: React state prevents unnecessary refetches
- **Period Toggle**: Only refetches when period actually changes
- **Shared Endpoint**: Reuses existing backend logic (no duplication)
- **Lightweight**: Compact payload (~500 bytes)

### No Backend Changes Required ✅
