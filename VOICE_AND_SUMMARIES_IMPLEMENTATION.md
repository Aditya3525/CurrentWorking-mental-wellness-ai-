## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Voice Input Architecture
```typescript
// Web Speech API Integration
const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
recognitionRef.current = new SpeechRecognition();

// Configuration
recognitionRef.current.continuous = false;  // Single phrase
recognitionRef.current.interimResults = false;  // Final only
recognitionRef.current.lang = 'en-US';

// Event Handlers
recognitionRef.current.onresult = (event) => {
  const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  setInputValue(transcript);
};
```

### Voice Output Architecture
```typescript
// Speech Synthesis API
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
utterance.rate = 1.0;  // Normal speed
utterance.pitch = 1.0;  // Normal pitch
utterance.volume = 1.0;  // Full volume

window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
```

### Summary Generation Flow
```
1. User completes conversation
2. Frontend calls: GET /api/chat/summary/:userId
3. Backend loads last 20 messages
4. AI analyzes conversation with prompt:
   - Extract key insights about mental state
   - Identify emotional patterns
   - List topics discussed
   - Suggest action items
   - Determine overall sentiment
5. AI returns structured JSON
6. Frontend displays in beautiful widget
```
