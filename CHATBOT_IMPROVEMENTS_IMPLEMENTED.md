```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Starters not loading

**Symptoms:** Empty starter cards or default suggestions  
**Solution:**
1. Check backend is running: `http://localhost:5000/api/chat/starters`
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check backend logs for errors in conversation memory

### Issue: Smart replies not appearing

**Symptoms:** No suggestion buttons below bot messages  
**Solution:**
1. Check API response includes `smartReplies` array
2. Verify `ChatResponsePayload` interface updated
3. Check bot response metadata for sentiment data
4. Verify `generateSmartReplies` method is called

### Issue: Starters not personalized

**Symptoms:** Only seeing generic starters  
**Solution:**
1. Ensure user has assessment data
