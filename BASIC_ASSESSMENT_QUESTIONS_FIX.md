# Basic Assessment Questions Fix - Complete

## Problem Identified

The combined assessment flow was retrieving **wrong questions** - instead of showing the short screening versions (GAD-2 with 2 questions, PHQ-2 with 2 questions, etc.), it was showing the **full assessment questions** (GAD-7 with 7 questions, PHQ-9 with 9 questions, etc.).

### Root Cause

The backend was mapping basic assessment type IDs to full assessment templates:
- `anxiety_gad2` → mapped to GAD-7 template (7 questions) ❌
- `depression_phq2` → mapped to PHQ-9 template (9 questions) ❌
- `stress_pss4` → mapped to PSS-10 template (10 questions) ❌

This was done via `TEMPLATE_TYPE_ALIASES` to reuse existing database definitions, but it caused the wrong number of questions to be displayed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Hardcoded Basic Assessment Definitions

**File:** `frontend/src/data/basicAssessmentDefinitions.ts` (NEW)

Created a complete definitions file with all 7 basic screening assessments:

| Assessment | Type ID | Questions | Description |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Anxiety (GAD-2)** | `anxiety_gad2` | 2 questions | Nervous/anxious feelings, worrying control |
| **Depression (PHQ-2)** | `depression_phq2` | 2 questions | Interest/pleasure, feeling down/hopeless |
| **Stress (PSS-4)** | `stress_pss4` | 4 questions | Control, confidence, things going well, difficulties piling up |
| **Overthinking (RRS-4)** | `overthinking_rrs4` | 4 questions | Wishing situation went better, "why do I react", understanding feelings, replaying events |
| **Trauma (PC-PTSD-5)** | `trauma_pcptsd5` | 5 questions | Nightmares, avoidance, on guard, detachment, guilt (yes/no) |
| **Emotional Intelligence (EQ-5)** | `emotional_intelligence_eq5` | 5 questions | Understanding emotions, managing emotions, empathy, motivation, social skills |
| **Personality (Big Five-10)** | `personality_bigfive10` | 10 questions | Extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness (2 questions each) |

### 2. Updated CombinedAssessmentFlow Component

**File:** `frontend/src/components/features/assessment/CombinedAssessmentFlow.tsx`

Modified the assessment fetching logic:

```typescript
// Separate basic assessments from others
const basicTypes = selectedTypes.filter(type => isBasicAssessment(type));
const otherTypes = selectedTypes.filter(type => !isBasicAssessment(type));

// Use hardcoded definitions for basic assessments
const basicTemplates: AssessmentTemplate[] = basicTypes.map(type => {
  const def = BASIC_ASSESSMENT_DEFINITIONS[type];
  return {
    assessmentType: def.assessmentType,
    definitionId: def.assessmentType,
    title: def.title,
    description: def.description,
    estimatedTime: `${def.estimatedMinutes} minutes`,
    questions: def.questions.map(q => ({
      id: q.id,
      text: q.text,
      responseType: q.type,
      uiType: q.type === 'yes-no' ? 'binary' : 'likert',
      options: q.options.map((opt, idx) => ({
        id: opt.id,
        value: opt.value,
        text: opt.text,
        order: idx
      }))
    })),
    scoring: { /* ... */ }
  };
});

// Fetch other assessments from backend
// Combine all templates
const allTemplates = [...basicTemplates, ...otherTemplates];
```

## Changes Summary

### Files Created
1. ✅ `frontend/src/data/basicAssessmentDefinitions.ts` - Complete basic assessment definitions

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `frontend/src/components/features/assessment/CombinedAssessmentFlow.tsx` - Updated to use hardcoded basic definitions
2. ✅ `backend/src/controllers/assessmentsController.ts` - Added basic type IDs to VALID_ASSESSMENT_TYPES and TEMPLATE_TYPE_ALIASES (from previous fix)

## How It Works Now

### Before (Wrong ❌)
1. Frontend requests `anxiety_gad2`
2. Backend maps to `anxiety` template → fetches GAD-7 (7 questions)
3. Frontend displays all 7 questions ❌

### After (Correct ✅)
1. Frontend requests `anxiety_gad2`
2. Frontend checks: Is this a basic assessment? → **Yes**
3. Frontend uses hardcoded GAD-2 definition (2 questions) ✅
4. Frontend displays only 2 questions ✅

### Backend Compatibility
The backend still accepts these type IDs and has proper scoring functions in `basicAssessments.ts`:
- `scoreGad2()` - 2-question anxiety scoring
- `scorePhq2()` - 2-question depression scoring
- `scorePss4()` - 4-question stress scoring
- `scoreRrs4()` - 4-question overthinking scoring
- `scorePcptsd5()` - 5-question trauma scoring
- `scoreEq5()` - 5-question EQ scoring
- `scoreBigFive()` - 10-question personality scoring
